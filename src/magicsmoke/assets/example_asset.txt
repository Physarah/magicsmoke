This is an example text file, you can put anything in src/magicsmoke/assets, like csv files, yaml files, jpgs,
basically anything your code might need to function that you don't want to store IN the code itself,
but still needs to be accessed by the user.

A good example is throughput tables for telescope bandpasses.
