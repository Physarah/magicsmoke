# Magic Smoke

"Magic Smoke" refers to the smoke which is installed in all electrical components, and is essential for them working correctly. You will usually hear it refered to by a sad Huntsman student who just blew up something up: "%@!# the magic smoke is escaping!". Once the magic smoke has escaped, the electrical component will not longer work (unless you purchase a magic smoke refill from IBM) 

This is a skeleton package for you to develop your own classes and packages based on my learnings from Huntsman. I hope this is the magic smoke that makes your code, and your work flow a little easier and faster.  

I'd like to reiterate however, there is no right or wrong way to do any of this. Expore, try new things, and enjoy having the freedom of being able to code however you like! Often our adversion to coding tools, stems from the fact we simply don't understand how they work just yet!
