# Magic Smoke

"Magic Smoke" refers to the smoke which is installed in all electrical components, and is essential for them working correctly. You will usually hear it refered to by a sad Huntsman student who just blew up something up: "%@!# the magic smoke is escaping!" Once the magic smoke has escaped, the electrical component will no longer work (unless you purchase a magic smoke refill from IBM) 

This is a skeleton package for you to develop your own classes and packages based on my learnings from Huntsman. I hope these learnings are the magic smoke that makes your code, and your work flow a little easier and faster.  

I'd like to reiterate however, there is no right or wrong way to do any of this. Expore, try new things, and enjoy having the freedom of being able to code however you like! Often our adversion to coding tools, operating systems, IDE's etc, stems from the fact we simply don't understand how they work just yet!  

### Byobu

Byobu is useful for those who often have lots of terminals open to do lots of processes, those who need to work on machines remotely, working on hardware in headless mode (no monitor) or if you want to close the window, but keep the process running (in particular flaking VPN's, bad connections etc, but you want the process to keep running even if you detatch from the bash terminal). 

##### Installing on OSX:

If you need to install homebrew:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

Then:
```
brew install byobu 
```
